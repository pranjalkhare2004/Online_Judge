# 🛠️ DEVELOPMENT MAINTENANCE GUIDE

## 📋 Code Documentation Standards

### File Header Documentation Format

Every significant code file should include a header comment with this format:

```javascript
/**
 * [FILE PURPOSE TITLE]
 * 
 * Purpose: Brief description of what this file does and why it exists.
 * 
 * Key Responsibilities:
 * - List the main functions this file performs
 * - Each responsibility on a separate line
 * - Be specific about what it handles
 * 
 * Why this exists: Explain the reasoning behind this file's existence,
 * what problem it solves, and how it fits into the larger system.
 */
```

### Examples by File Type

#### Controllers
```javascript
/**
 * [ENTITY] CONTROLLER
 * 
 * Purpose: Handles HTTP requests and business logic for [entity] operations.
 * This controller processes requests, validates data, interacts with models,
 * and returns appropriate responses.
 * 
 * Key Responsibilities:
 * - Handle CRUD operations for [entity]
 * - Validate request data and parameters
 * - Implement business logic and rules
 * - Return structured API responses
 * 
 * Why this exists: Controllers separate HTTP handling from business logic,
 * making the code more organized and testable. This controller centralizes
 * all [entity]-related operations.
 */
```

#### Models
```javascript
/**
 * [ENTITY] MODEL SCHEMA
 * 
 * Purpose: Defines the data structure and validation rules for [entity] in the database.
 * This Mongoose schema ensures data consistency and provides methods for data operations.
 * 
 * Key Responsibilities:
 * - Define schema fields with validation rules
 * - Implement pre/post middleware hooks
 * - Provide instance and static methods
 * - Handle data relationships and references
 * 
 * Why this exists: Database models ensure data integrity and provide a consistent
 * interface for data operations. This schema defines how [entity] data is stored
 * and accessed throughout the application.
 */
```

#### React Components
```javascript
/**
 * [COMPONENT NAME] COMPONENT
 * 
 * Purpose: Provides the user interface for [specific functionality]. This component
 * handles user interactions and displays relevant data.
 * 
 * Key Responsibilities:
 * - Render UI elements for [functionality]
 * - Handle user input and events
 * - Manage local component state
 * - Communicate with parent components/services
 * 
 * Why this exists: This component encapsulates the UI logic for [functionality],
 * making it reusable and maintainable. It separates presentation from business logic.
 */
```

## 🔧 File Organization Rules

### Backend Structure
```
backend/src/
├── config/         # Configuration files only
├── models/         # Database schemas only
├── controllers/    # HTTP request handlers only
├── middleware/     # Request processing functions only
├── routes/         # Route definitions only
├── services/       # External service integrations only
├── utils/          # Helper functions and utilities only
└── scripts/        # Database and setup scripts only
```

### Frontend Structure
```
frontend/src/
├── components/     # Reusable UI components only
├── pages/          # Route-specific page components only
├── services/       # API communication only
├── context/        # React context providers only
├── hooks/          # Custom React hooks only
└── utils/          # Helper functions only
```

## 📝 Naming Conventions

### Files and Directories
- **Backend**: Use kebab-case (e.g., `user-controller.js`, `auth-middleware.js`)
- **Frontend**: Use PascalCase for components (e.g., `UserProfile.js`, `LoginForm.js`)
- **Config/Utils**: Use camelCase (e.g., `databaseConfig.js`, `validationHelpers.js`)

### Variables and Functions
- **JavaScript**: Use camelCase (e.g., `userName`, `handleSubmit`, `validateEmail`)
- **Constants**: Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `API_BASE_URL`, `MAX_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS`)
- **Components**: Use PascalCase (e.g., `UserProfile`, `NavigationBar`)

### Database Fields
- **MongoDB**: Use camelCase (e.g., `firstName`, `createdAt`, `isActive`)
- **IDs**: Use descriptive names (e.g., `userId`, `problemId`, not just `id`)

## 🚀 Adding New Features

### 1. Backend API Endpoint
1. Create/update model in `models/`
2. Add controller methods in `controllers/`
3. Define routes in `routes/`
4. Add middleware if needed in `middleware/`
5. Update API documentation

### 2. Frontend Component
1. Create component in appropriate directory (`components/` or `pages/`)
2. Add to routing in `App.js` if it's a page
3. Create service functions in `services/` for API calls
4. Add context/state management if needed

### 3. Documentation Requirements
- Add header documentation to all new files
- Update README if adding major features
- Document API endpoints and their usage
- Add comments for complex business logic

## 🔒 Security Guidelines

### Backend Security
- Always validate input data
- Use parameterized queries (Mongoose handles this)
- Implement proper authentication middleware
- Hash passwords with bcrypt
- Use environment variables for secrets
- Implement rate limiting

### Frontend Security
- Validate user input before sending to API
- Store JWT tokens securely
- Implement proper error handling
- Sanitize user-generated content
- Use HTTPS in production

## 🧪 Testing Standards

### Backend Testing
- Write unit tests for controllers
- Test API endpoints with proper auth
- Test model validation rules
- Mock external services

### Frontend Testing
- Test component rendering
- Test user interactions
- Test API service functions
- Test authentication flows

## 📊 Performance Guidelines

### Backend Performance
- Use database indexing
- Implement pagination for large datasets
- Cache frequently accessed data
- Optimize database queries
- Use compression middleware

### Frontend Performance
- Lazy load components when possible
- Optimize images and assets
- Use React.memo for expensive components
- Implement proper loading states
- Minimize bundle size

## 🔄 Code Review Checklist

### Before Submitting Code
- [ ] All files have proper header documentation
- [ ] Code follows naming conventions
- [ ] No hardcoded values (use environment variables)
- [ ] Error handling is implemented
- [ ] Security best practices followed
- [ ] Tests are written and passing
- [ ] Code is properly formatted
- [ ] No debugging code left in production

### Review Criteria
- [ ] Code is readable and well-documented
- [ ] Functionality works as expected
- [ ] Security vulnerabilities addressed

## 🚨 Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Don't** mix business logic with HTTP handling in routes
2. **Don't** store sensitive data in frontend code
3. **Don't** forget to validate user input
4. **Don't** create circular dependencies between modules
5. **Don't** hardcode configuration values
6. **Don't** ignore error handling
7. **Don't** skip documentation for complex logic

## 📞 Getting Help

1. Check existing documentation first
2. Look for similar implementations in the codebase
3. Review the project structure and conventions
4. Ask for code review before merging changes
5. Update documentation when making changes

This guide ensures consistent, maintainable, and secure code throughout the project lifecycle.
