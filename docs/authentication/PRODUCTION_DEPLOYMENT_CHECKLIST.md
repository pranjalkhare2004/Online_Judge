# Edit .env file with production values
```

### 3. Database Migration
```bash
cd Backend
npm run migrate:up
```

### 4. Security and Cleanup Testing

```

## 🔒 SECURITY TEST VALIDATION

The following security tests must PASS before production deployment:

### Authentication Tests
- [ ] Public endpoints don't set session cookies
- [ ] User registration validates input properly
- [ ] Login creates secure session/JWT tokens
- [ ] Session cookies have HttpOnly and Secure attributes
- [ ] Protected routes require valid authentication
- [ ] Logout properly invalidates sessions/tokens
- [ ] Post-logout access is properly restricted

### Authorization Tests
- [ ] User roles and permissions enforced
- [ ] Admin routes protected from regular users
- [ ] User data isolation properly implemented
- [ ] Cross-user data access prevented

### Input Validation Tests
- [ ] SQL injection prevention
- [ ] XSS prevention
- [ ] CSRF protection enabled
- [ ] File upload validation
- [ ] Request size limits enforced

### Infrastructure Security
- [ ] Security headers present (Helmet)
- [ ] Rate limiting functional
- [ ] HTTPS redirect working
- [ ] Error messages don't leak sensitive info
- [ ] Debug mode disabled in production

## 📊 PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS

### Response Times (95th percentile)
- [ ] Authentication endpoints: < 500ms
- [ ] Problem listing: < 1000ms
- [ ] Code submission: < 2000ms
- [ ] User profile: < 300ms
- [ ] Leaderboard: < 800ms

### Resource Usage
- [ ] Memory usage: < 512MB per instance
- [ ] CPU usage: < 70% under normal load
- [ ] Database connections: < 20 per instance
- [ ] File system usage: < 10GB

### Scalability
- [ ] Horizontal scaling tested
- [ ] Database connection pooling
- [ ] Session store (Redis) configured
- [ ] Load balancer health checks working

## 🔍 POST-DEPLOYMENT VALIDATION

After deployment, verify these endpoints:

### Health Checks
```bash
curl https://your-domain.com/api/health
# Should return 200 with system status
```

### Authentication Flow
```bash
# Register user
curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"Test123!","username":"testuser","fullName":"Test User"}'

# Login user
curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"Test123!"}'
```

### Protected Routes
```bash
# Test protected route (should return 401 without token)
curl https://your-domain.com/api/user/profile

# Test with token (replace TOKEN with actual JWT)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" https://your-domain.com/api/user/profile
```

### Security Headers
```bash
curl -I https://your-domain.com/api/health
# Check for security headers: X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, etc.
```

## 🚨 ROLLBACK PROCEDURES

If deployment fails or issues are detected:

### 1. Immediate Rollback
```bash
# Switch to previous version
git checkout previous-stable-tag
# Redeploy previous version
```

### 2. Database Rollback
```bash
# Rollback database migrations if needed
npm run migrate:down
```

### 3. Service Recovery
```bash
# Restart services with previous configuration
# Check logs for error details
# Notify stakeholders of issues
```

## 📈 MONITORING ALERTS

Set up alerts for:

### Critical Alerts (Immediate Response)
- [ ] Service down (>1 minute)
- [ ] Database connection failure
- [ ] Authentication system failure
- [ ] High error rate (>5%)
- [ ] Memory usage >90%

### Warning Alerts (Monitor Closely)
- [ ] Response time >2x normal
- [ ] High request rate (potential attack)
- [ ] Disk space >80%
- [ ] Failed login attempts spike
- [ ] Unusual user activity patterns

## 🎯 SUCCESS CRITERIA

Deployment is successful when:

- [ ] All health checks pass
- [ ] Authentication flow works end-to-end
- [ ] Core functionality (problems, submissions) operational
- [ ] Security tests pass with zero critical issues
- [ ] Performance metrics within acceptable ranges
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting functional
- [ ] No critical errors in logs for 1 hour post-deployment
