## 🔧 Production Environment Setup

### Backend Deployment (Node.js)
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm ci --only=production

# Set environment
export NODE_ENV=production

# Start with PM2
pm2 start server.js --name "online-judge-backend"
pm2 startup
pm2 save
```

### Frontend Deployment (Next.js)
```bash
# Build for production
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start

# Or deploy to Vercel/Netlify
vercel deploy --prod
```

### Database Configuration
```javascript
// Production MongoDB setup
{
  "uri": "mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/online-judge",
  "options": {
    "useNewUrlParser": true,
    "useUnifiedTopology": true,
    "maxPoolSize": 50,
    "serverSelectionTimeoutMS": 5000,
    "socketTimeoutMS": 45000,
    "family": 4
  }
}
```

### Nginx Configuration
```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name api.your-domain.com;
    
    ssl_certificate /path/to/cert.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /path/to/key.pem;
    
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:5000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
}
```

## 🚨 Incident Response

### Authentication Service Down
1. Check service status
2. Verify database connectivity
3. Check for DDoS attacks
4. Scale infrastructure if needed
5. Communicate status to users

### Security Breach
1. Immediately invalidate all tokens
2. Force password reset for affected users
3. Review audit logs
4. Patch security vulnerabilities
5. Report to stakeholders

### Performance Issues
1. Check server resources
2. Analyze database performance
3. Review recent deployments
4. Scale infrastructure
5. Optimize bottlenecks
